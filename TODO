TODO List
=-------=

* Get a better tar.c (parsing engine) from GNU tar or write it from scratch.

* Implement passive translator settings: this could typically be done using
  the `link' field of the tar header to store the translator command line;
  then we could use an unused byte of the header to say that there is a
  translator set on this node.  For symlinks, we would not show any passive
  translator setting.

* Implement netfs_S_io_map ().

* Update the gzip store to make it more robust (for instance, find *real*
  specifications of the header format).
