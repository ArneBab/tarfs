Known tarfs bugs
=--------------=


1. General

* Doesn't pass the "ustar-all-quickest.tar" test file with long links.
* io_map () not implemented (gcc uses it unfortunately).
* netfs.c (netfs_get_dirents): too much memory may be allocated (mmap'd).


2. Writable fs bugs

* UIDs/GIDs are not properly handled (uses numbers instead of strings).
* Deadlock when syncing the filesystem at tarfs.c:tarfs_sync_fs when
  trying to acquire the lock of a node (couldn't reproduce it though).


3. Zip stores bug

* Missing feature: RPC encoding/decoding stuff not supported.

  Note: The gzip and bzip2 stores sharing most of their code, there is a
        high probability that any bug occuring with on backend should also
	occur with the other.  If you encounter a bug, please try using
	both backends to see if that makes any difference.  The code is
	also very close to what's in cache.c.


For more bugs, "grep '\(FIXME\|XXX\)' *.c" should do the trick.
